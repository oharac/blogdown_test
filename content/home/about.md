# About Me
-->
I am a PhD student studying equity issues in marine conservation at UC Santa Barbara Bren School of Environmental Science and Management, advised by Ben Halpern.  I continue to work with the [Ocean Health Index](www.ohi-science.org) team at the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](www.nceas.ucsb.edu), where I lead the [British Columbia Ocean Health Index assessment](http://www.ohibc.org).

My research will focus on process and outcome equity in environmental management - a confluence of ecology, natural resource economics, and behavioral economics.  In particular I am interested in marine spatial planning to engage multiple ocean users in decision making that ensures equitable and sustainable access to marine resources and services.

Principles of open, reproducible data science are fundamental to my philosophy of practice as a scientist.  [“Our path to better science in less time”](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160) outlines the story of our Ocean Health Index team’s evolution toward open science best practices, using R, R Studio, and Github to collaborate and communicate our research. 

In a previous life, I taught high school integrated science, physics, and engineering design.  As a Senior Fellow of the [Knowles Teacher Initiative](https://knowlesteachers.org/), I continue to work with teachers as a coach and collaborative planner, but I do miss working with my students to help them explore and discover the laws of the universe. 

In my copious free time as a grad student, I enjoy scuba diving and playing music, but not at the same time.
