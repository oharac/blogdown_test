<h1>Experience</h1>
<p>Research Assistant, Ocean Health Index (January 2015 – present) NCEAS - Santa Barbara, CA * Develop code to update and improve goal models for the annual global Ocean Health Index (OHI), assessing the ways in which a healthy ocean provides a range of sustainable benefits to people now and in the future. Synthesize global spatial and time-series datasets, including species distributions, extinction risk, marine protected areas, and economic sustainability of tourism. * Coordinate code development and analysis for OHI British Columbia. Discover and manage data, develop goal models, and communicate analysis to adapt general OHI goals to the unique social and environmental context of British Columbia, involving stakeholder groups with diverse cultural, economic, and environmental value systems. * Promote reproducible methods and open science tools within OHI, including using R/R Studio and GitHub to develop, communicate, and make freely available all analyses and results. * As lead author, submitted manuscript “Aligning marine species range data to better serve science and conservation” to PLoS ONE (in review). Manuscript quantitatively compares IUCN and AquaMaps species distribution maps and identifies methods to improve confidence in these two important marine species range databases. AAAS Mass Media Science Fellowship (June 2014 - August 2014) The Oregonian - Portland, OR * Worked with Oregonian editors and reporters on science and environmental coverage and multimedia content. Published investigations include forage fish management by Pacific Fishery Management Council, salmon management within the Columbia River basin, and wolf conservation under the Oregon Endangered Species Act. Masters Thesis Group Project (April 2013 - June 2014) Bren School - Santa Barbara, CA “Offshore wind energy in the context of multiple ocean uses on the Bermuda platform” Client: Department of Environmental Protection, Bermuda * Coordinated a cross-functional team to research and develop a novel approach to marine spatial planning to inform offshore wind energy development on the Bermuda Platform. Developed technical approach including single-sector and multi-sector tradeoff analyses for work plan and final document. * Programmed MATLAB scripts and functions to model wind energy resources, perform spatial tradeoff analyses, and optimize wind farm scenarios based on GIS data and stakeholder preferences. * Developed and delivered thesis presentations to thesis defense panel, client representatives, and various public audiences. Summer Program Consultant (June 2013 - August 2013) The School for Examining Essential Questions of Sustainability (SEEQS) Charter School - Honolulu, HI * Worked with founder of SEEQS to develop sustainability rubrics, learner profile, and school culture for a new grades 6-12 charter school with focus on project-based learning and environmental sustainability. Charter philosophy based on the Envision Education and p4c Hawai’i (Philosophy for Children) models. Science Teacher (August 2004 - June 2012) Carlmont High School - Belmont, CA * Taught AP Physics-B, honors physics, college prep physics, integrated science, and Engineering &amp; Green Technology in a socioeconomically diverse 2200-student public high school. * Designed project-based Engineering &amp; Green Technology course, in which students practice fundamental skills in engineering, sustainability, and project management through engineering challenges including LEED green building design, energy audits, solar tracking robots, and “appropriate technology” design. * Acquired $20,000 in grants for course supplies, including probeware, lab equipment, and robotics kits.</p>
